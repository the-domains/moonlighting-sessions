The story begins in Miami, and it moves onto different places around the world, just because there is a bit of innovation in all of us, and well, we are everywhere!\_So people who work in their garages can still work in their garages, but we'd like to help you take your ideas to the next level. There are a bunch of us ready to help. We like to work together, and obviously in your own time. We know everyone is full of things to do, but we carve out a little bit of time from wherever we can to work on some passion we may have. Or an idea we think can change the world. Or a dream we finally decided to make come true. We always find the time. Moonlightings gives you the place. The place to hang out. The place to talk shop with others who possibly don't know the ins and outs of your expertise, but they definitely know the ins and outs of other pieces you'll need to make this all come together. So, welcome to Moonlightings! It's great to have you here, to work on truly innovating and making the world amazing over and over again. It's going to be fun, so stick around. We promise to make it worth your while.\_"
